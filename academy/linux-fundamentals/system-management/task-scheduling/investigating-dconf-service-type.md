## Challenge


Find the service type of `dconf.service`.


I first tried:


```bash
systemctl show dconf.service -p Type
```

But the result was empty:

```bash
Type=
```

So I searched for the service file directly:

```bash
locate dconf.service
```

This returned:

```bash
/usr/lib/systemd/user/dconf.service
```
I then checked the file:


```bash
cat /usr/lib/systemd/user/dconf.service
```

The service configuration showed:

```bash
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/dconf-service
Type=dbus
BusName=ca.desrt.dconf
```
Result

The service type is:
```bash
dbus
```
What I Learned
systemctl show may not always return the expected value.
User-level systemd services can be stored under /usr/lib/systemd/user/.
If a command does not give enough information, checking the underlying service file directly can help.
